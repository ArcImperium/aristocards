There is a help button that displays most of the following.
Make a bet and click "deal" to start the game.
Cards are notated as "number""suit", regular deck of 52 playing cards.
Hit to draw a card, stand to end your turn.
The computer will take its turn (doesn't show the cards the computer deals).
The computer will hit if it is below 17 and below player score.
Regular Blackjack rules declares a winner. 
You can change your bet or deal again.
Manage your coin balance and bet.
Also, the gmae will crash sometimes (I don't know why, it does it randomly), if so you can refresh (which also resets coin balance).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
